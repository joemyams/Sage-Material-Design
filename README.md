# Sage-Material-Design

The theme is a fork of Sage Starter Theme version 8.2.1 with Material Design implemented on top of Bootstrap.

*Under construction*! It's a dev repo!

## Installation

Clone the git repo - `git clone https://github.com/roots/sage.git` and then rename the directory to the name of your theme or website.

If you don't use [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock), you'll need to add the following to your `wp-config.php` on your development installation:

```php
define('WP_ENV', 'development');
```

## Configuration

Edit `lib/config.php` to enable or disable theme features

Edit `lib/init.php` to setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system and [Bower](http://bower.io/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install gulp and Bower

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io/) globally with `npm install -g gulp bower`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`
3. Run `bower install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.
